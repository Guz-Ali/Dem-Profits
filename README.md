# Dem-Profits
Find the best price and number of product to achieve maximum profits with your product through formulas. (use "max" for this)

By inputting the formulas of average cost and revenue, you can find the optimal price/expected cost for your product. (use "p", "c", "mr" or "mc" for this)


Uses equilibrium logic from microeconomics.

Logic of equilibrium: The maximum profit will be at the point where marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal to each other. Using this point (number of product) find revenue and cost, then find the profit.


Given the formulas of Average Price and Average Cost, program finds the Marginal Price and Marginal Cost. (MR and MC can be manually given, too.)

Since our maximum profit will be at MR=MC, turn this into a function. MR-MC=0

Using NEWTON'S THEOREM of Finding Roots, find the root. What we find here is the number of products. (our x number in the function)

Apply number of products (x) on AR and AC, and substract cost from revenue.

We found the maximum profit.(and also the number of products to achieve it)
